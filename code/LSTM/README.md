# LSTM folder

In this folder you can find the code used for our LSTM networks. This code is not meant to be run and will not produce any meaningful results. Still it is an example of how a LSTM could be defined/trained.
We abandoned this approach in favor on focusing on Feed Forward Networks.

## Structure

* Use training_data_generator.py to produce the training data.
* Run trainer.py to produce and save a network. Be careful to use the right ID.
* Try out your trained network with play_world.py.
