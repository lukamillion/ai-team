# LSTM folder

In this folder you can find the code used for our LSTM networks. This is legacy code and will not produce any meaningful results. We abandoned this approach in favor on focusing on Feed Forward Networks.

## Structure

* Use training_data_generator.py to produce the training data.
* Run trainer.py to produce and save a network. Be careful to use the right ID.
* Try out your trained network with play_world.py.
