Bottleneck Data "AO" from JÃ¼hlich university.

The original data is formated as seperated file. In order to work with the DataLoader we need a fixed with file. We used the [Skript](csv_to_fwf.py) to convert the Formating.

naming convention: "ao-num1-num2_combine.txt":
      
      num1:   bottleneck width (cm)
      num2:   people count
