# ai-team

This repository is used to work together on the code needed for our GESS lecture.


----Goals----

-Produce AI that behaves as close as possible to a human
-Observe Agent's behaviour when put into the training situation
-Put multiple Agents into one world and observe behaviour
-Focus on situations to uni-directional flow
-Compare real data with our simulated "many agent"-world


----Technical Decisions----

-Use PyTorch
-Do not include environment data as input to the network
-Don't include explicit goals into the AI 
-Datasets are not chosen universally, datasets should be uploaded to git when pretty enough
